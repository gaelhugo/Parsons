<b>Course Description</b>
This course provides a project-driven studio to introduce the basic vocabularies, concepts, practices and contexts of creative coding. From designing simple abstract shapes to developing more complex interactive toys, students will learn how to use existing libraries, how to build their own ones and how to mix them. Through screen oriented projects, students will work on experimental experiences, combining graphic design, motion design and sound design essentially with Javascript.

<b>Class Description</b>
The class will be divided in 4 parts, introducing the following notions:
Drawing & Moving : introduction to some fundamentals of dynamic drawing and generative motion in an experimental web context. 
Interaction: introduction to the notion of user interactions and nonlinear scenarios
Play: introduction to the notion of graphic games and useless (but playful) graphic toys. 
Control: introduction to external communication tool such as midi controller

Each of these concepts will be discussed in class and related in 4 personal projects, accompanied by technical introduction, references, examples and discussions.
